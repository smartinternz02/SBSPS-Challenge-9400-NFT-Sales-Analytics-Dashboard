## Description
We have used Tableau which is a interactive data visualization software tool. Here we
have performed the analysis of NFT History Sales
(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathurinache/nft-history-sales) Dataset found on
Kaggle.
As per the requirements we needed to create dashboard that can visualize NFT Data and
grab insights from it that can help buyers as well as Sellers.
Using Tableau we have prepared 3 Dashboards:
1. To analyze sales over the years and to visualize patterns and trends
2. Analysis of primary and secondary sales
3. USD Sales Analysis over time
We have also forecasted the trend and the sales for the year 2022 and compared it with
the actual output.

In the world of blockchain and Decentralized finance, investors may easily fall into the
“liquidity trap”. In such situations we can only rely on data to stay away from “hearsay”
and decide if we want to invest in NFTs or not.
The time to roll out of our solution would be significantly less than other solutions due to
the choice of our tool - Tableau. The advantages we would have are:
1. Tableau enhances the user experience by providing different types of visualization
options also it can be easily learnt in a short period
2. We can save a significant amount of time by analyzing data at high speed also data
from existing Excel sheets are also transferred to Tableau to complete tasks quickly.
3. We can make “live” connections to different data sources like SQL etc.
4. Tableau server will help to host and manage Tableau data sources, workbooks,
reports, and dashboards created on Tableau Desktop
In terms of resources tableau is a full-fledged software, and it doesn’t require the support of other
tools or hardware to function.
Tableau is relatively a low-cost solution compared to other big data counterparts such as Qlik and
Business Objects.
Our analysis of NFT sales will provide traders, builders, and collectors gain a competitive edge
and prevent them from making the wrong decisions and hence losing money.
